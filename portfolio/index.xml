      <description>2d simulation prep for AI training been stucked with trying to figure out how to create a 3D simulation so I can start playing around with AI.

      <description>A Dream I had a dream.
I was standing in a misty space. Patterns of dark violet and light green light pervaded the mist.
A skeleton appeared. He approached me while constantly whirling. I knew he was a Sufi.
He got closed to me and grabbed my hand. I started to whirl with him.
He was all bones, but his movement was soft and smooth. He had no lips, but like any other skeletons, he always seemed to be laughing and so cheerful.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>1 câu chuyện nhỏ this story is better told in Vietnamese.
Đồng tiền đầu tiên mà mình kiếm được là nhờ nặn đất sét, lúc mình học lớp 4.
Lúc đó, mỗi ngày mình đc ba mẹ cho 2000 VND đi học. Với số tiền này thì mình có thể mua 1 tô mì, hoặc 2 xâu cá viên chiên.
Trong lớp mình có 1 đứa rất là giàu, chi tiền như người lớn.</description>
